# InstacartGroceryBasket-Python
I used data exploratory analysis to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on provided criteria and information on sales patterns.

## Introduction
The stakeholders have assumed that they can't target everyone using the same methods, and have considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products. There is need to inform through analysis what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products. Also, we are required to answer the following key questions:

## Key Questions & Objectives

1.  What days of the week and hours of the day are busiest?

2.  What times of the day do people spend the most money?

3.   Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others?

4.   What's the distribution amoung users in regards to their brand loyalty?

5.   Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's loyalty status?

6. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's region? 

7. Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?

8. What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, frequency of orders, products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.
